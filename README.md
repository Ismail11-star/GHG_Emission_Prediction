# GHG_Emission_Prediction
GHG Emission Prediction Project Predicts US supply chain GHG emission factors (2010-2016) from industry/commodity data. Uses regression models (Linear, Random Forest) with quality metrics. Steps: load, preprocess (clean, encode, scale), train, evaluate (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²), tune, and select the best model.
